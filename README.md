## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt to use a CSS properties and styles reset which is considered a good practice and was also able to reinforce some skills like CSS grid.

```css
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 30rem);
}
```

### Continued development

I still need to implement media queries so the design can be mobile-responsive.
